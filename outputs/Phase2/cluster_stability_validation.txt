CLUSTER STABILITY CROSS-VALIDATION
================================

Analysis Date: 2025-04-28 06:12:28
Number of Clusters: 2

STABILITY METRICS
================
Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) Stability: 0.4527
Normalized Stability Score: 0.3464
Average Assignment Entropy: 0.4530

STABILITY INTERPRETATION
=======================
Stability Level: MODERATE
Interpretation: The clustering solution shows moderate stability across variations. While core cluster structures appear consistent, there is notable variation in boundary cases. The clusters likely represent real patterns, but should be interpreted with some caution.

Normalized Stability: 0.3464 (scale: 0-1)
Assignment Consistency: Instance assignments show low consistency across clustering variations, with substantial variability in how instances are grouped.

ARI DISTRIBUTION SUMMARY
=======================
Mean ARI: 0.4527
Median ARI: 0.6051
Min ARI: -0.0731
Max ARI: 1.0000
Std Dev: 0.3054

METHODOLOGY NOTES
================
- Stability was assessed by rerunning clustering with variations:
  1. Feature perturbation: Adding small random noise to features
  2. Feature subsampling: Using random subsets of features
  3. Instance subsampling: Using random subsets of instances
- Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) measures similarity between cluster assignments
- Normalized stability is based on entropy of cluster assignments
- Co-occurrence matrix shows how often pairs of instances cluster together
